In search of some new podcast episodes to listen to on the walk to work I've returned to the excellent [Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g). They have a four part series discussing the future impact of artificial intelligence on different aspects of life. The discussions are based around Stuart Russell's Reith lecture; [Living With Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001216k).

These were released some time ago but I only came across them this week. Worth a listen.
