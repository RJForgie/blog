I'm Ryan Forgie and I am a software engineer who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I work across the web stack; primarily in the JavaScript ecosystem. Outside of work I have a soft spot for Ruby and Python. 

The aim of this site is to learn in public, share thoughts on building software and document the journey to become a wizard.

In my free time I run up hills, ride my bike and lift weights.
