Hello i'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I work across the web stack; primarily in the JavaScript ecosystem. Outside of work I have a soft spot for Ruby and Python. 

The aim of this site is to learn in public, share thoughts on building software and document the journey to [become a wizard](https://jvns.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard/).

In my free time I run up hills, ride my bike and lift weights.
